				We’ll be saying the “I dos (heck yeahs!)” and celebrating at <a href="http://eventsatthefarm.com">Khimaira Farm</a> near Luray, Virginia at <strong>6PM on July 3rd</strong>. After getting engaged in the nearby Shenandoah Valley and spending many weekends away from DC in the area, we wanted to share its beauty with you. We hope you can join us for the wedding!

			<strong><em>If you plan to attend the wedding, it is important to book your lodging accommodations early. Like right now!</em></strong>
			<p>
			Luray is a popular weekend destination - especially on holiday weekends - and we want to make sure you find a place.
			</p>
			<p>
			<h2>Hotels</h2>
			<p>Many wedding guests will be staying at the <a href="http://www.mimslyninn.com">Mimslyn Inn</a> and the <a href="http://book.bestwestern.com/bestwestern/US/VA/Luray-hotels/BEST-WESTERN-Intown-of-Luray/Hotel-Overview.do?propertyCode=4710">Best Western in downtown Luray</a> (across the street from each other). Shuttle service will available on the evening of the wedding to and from these hotels. Khaimaira (the venue) also has ample parking if you prefer to drive.</p>
			<h2>Cabin and Home Rentals</h2>
			<h3>Allstar Lodging</h3>
			<p>
			Find them online at: <a href="http://www.allstarlodging.com">www.allstarlodging.com</a> or call 1-866-780-7827
			</p>
			<p>
			Many of the cabins will be listed as saying they are in Stanley, a neighboring town to Luray. Khimaira Farm is actually about halfway between Luray and Stanley so properties in Stanley are not far. The best way to book would be to call as they are very friendly and familiar with the area and know which cabins are closest to Khimaira Farm.
			</p>
			<h3>Vacation Rental by Owner (VRBO)</h3>
			<p>
			They also might have more flexibility since you’ll be working directly with the cabin owner as opposed to a management company. Find them online at: <a href="http://www.vrbo.com">www.vrbo.com</a>
